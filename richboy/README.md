My great-grandmother gifted me a special disk when she passed away. She told me
that it held the secret to infinite wealth and happiness. Unfortunately, I left
the disk under the sun for too long and I suspect that a thick solar flare might
have corrupted a _byte_ on it.

In any case, can you fix the disk for me and figure out what's on it? I really
need that infinite wealth right now. You can find the disk image in the file
`treasure`.
